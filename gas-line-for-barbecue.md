# Gas Line for Barbecue

Since the house uses natural gas, rather than using propane tanks for the barbecue, I could get a natural gas line run from the house out to the pad next to the deck. This would allow me to have a natural gas barbecue and never have to worry about propane tank refills again.

* [ ] Determine if barbecue can be converted from propane to natural gas
* [ ] Have natural gas line run
* [ ] Convert existing barbecue or purchase new one
